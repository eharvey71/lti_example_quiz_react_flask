# Simple LTI 1.3 Quiz App

A Single Page App built with React and Tailwind CSS on top of a Flask backend, which handles the following:

- Database interactions - SQLite in our example.
  
- APIs for CRUD operations on the database.
  
- LTI 1.3 Tool - messaging and grade passback testing.
  

Uses the excellent [pylti1p3](https://pypi.org/project/PyLTI1p3/) library for Python.
